# AWS Serverless AI - 2026 Learning Journey

My year-long journey learning AWS AI Engineering (Serverless) in public.

**Goal:** Apply for AWS Community Builders Program in January 2027

## About This Project

I'm spending 2026 building serverless AI applications on AWS, documenting every step, challenge, and learning along the way.

## What I'm Learning

- Amazon Bedrock (Claude, Nova models)
- AWS Lambda & API Gateway
- Serverless architecture patterns
- AI application development
- Cost optimization strategies
- Infrastructure as Code

## Projects

### Week 1: Hello Bedrock ✅
Built my first serverless AI function using Lambda + Bedrock (Nova AI)
- [Project Files](./01-hello-bedrock)
- Key Learning: IAM permissions, model formats, error debugging

### Week 2: Coming Soon...
Adding API Gateway to make the AI publicly accessible

## Following Along?

I'm sharing my journey on LinkedIn and documenting everything in detail.
